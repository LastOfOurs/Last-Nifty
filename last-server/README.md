# Plasma Cash ERC721

`Loo.sol` represents an ERC721 implementation of an NFT contract. 

`RootChain.sol` represents the Plasma Cash Contract. The contract inherits from `ERC721Receiver` in order to trigger the `deposit` function, when an NFT gets transferred to the address of the contract. It also inherits from `SparseMerkleTree` in order to do validation of Merkle Proofs.
